   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to cue's documentation!
========================================

The :func:`cue <cue>` Python package contains elements commonly used during
development of scripts and applications so you can spend your energy creating
great tools instead of re-implementing the same objects over and over.

If it's your first time here, check the  :doc:`Getting Started <gettingstarted>`
section to see what the package is all about and how it might help you. The
examples within the section should give you a taste of the functionality
available.

If you are only interested on the specifics of each class, you are better off
checking the :doc:`API <api>`.
